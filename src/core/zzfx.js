  Modifications for this template: only buildSamples() is kept, as a plain
  function taking the sample rate as a final argument and without the global
  volume scale. The original module creates an AudioContext at import time,
  which browsers block before a user gesture; playback here goes through
  AudioService so the platform/ad/user mute priority applies to every sound.
